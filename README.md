# Clinical-Trials-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing real-world clinical trial datasets to uncover insights into study phases, conditions, interventions, sponsors, enrollment trends, and trial outcomes. Clinical trial data is often complex and unstructured, so the goal of this project is to clean, standardize, explore, and visualize key variables that drive decision-making in pharma and healthcare research.

### 🔍 Objective

To perform end-to-end data analysis on clinical trial records and generate insights that support research strategy, feasibility assessment, and evidence-based planning.

### 🧪 Key Analyses Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing of ClinicalTrials.gov metadata

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on:

Study phases (Phase 1–4 distribution)

Enrollment size patterns

Intervention types (Drug, Device, Behavioral, etc.)

Sponsor categories (Industry, Academic, NIH)

Condition-wise trial distribution

Trial status categories (Recruiting, Completed, Withdrawn, etc.)

Time-series analysis of trial registrations over the years

Visualizations to identify research trends and therapeutic focus areas

Statistical summaries and dataset profiling

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Data Processing: Jupyter Notebook

Data Source: ClinicalTrials.gov API / public registry dataset

### 📈 What This Project Demonstrates

Ability to work with large structured & semi-structured biomedical datasets

Strong data cleaning & transformation skills

Insight extraction from clinical research data

Real-world analytics aligned with pharma, CRO, and healthcare data-science roles

### 📉 Sample Outcomes
